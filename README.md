**fathomR** is an R package designed to interface with the [Fathom](https://fathomcentral.com/learn) API. It allows users to authenticate, retrieve, and filter telemetry and deployment data from acoustic telemetry studies with ease. The resulting dataframes are in a format compatable with the actel package (https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install the package directly from GitHub, use the following commands in R:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("Eugies/FathomR")

# Load the package
library(fathomR)
```

## ðŸ“¦Authentication

To authenticate user login details and select workspace, use the following commands in R:

```r
# Authenticate using Fathom username and password
auth <- authenticate_wrapper()
# This will launch a browser window to log in and return a token and workspace ID
```

## ðŸ“¦Receiver deployments

To fetch all receiver deployment data, use the following commands in R:

```r
# deployments
deployments<-get_deployments(token = auth$token,  #if not specified then authentication will prompt a new login
                             ws_id = auth$ws_id) #if not specified then authentication will prompt a new login
```

## ðŸ“¦Spatial

To fetch Spatial data of receivers, use the following commands in R:

```r
# spatial
spatial <- get_spatial(
  StationName = c("BB", "Creole"),        # All stations containing BB or Creole (case sensative)
  #Receivers = c("1361", "800"),        # All receivers containing these substrings
  Receivers = "all",   
  #Area = list(lon = c(30.2, 30.6), lat = c(-89, -88)),
  token = auth$token,
  ws_id = auth$ws_id
)
```

## ðŸ“¦Biometrics

To fetch biometrics data of tagged individuals, use the following commands in R:

```r
# biometrics
biometrics <- get_biometrics(token = auth$token, ws_id = auth$ws_id)
```

## ðŸ“¦Detections

To fetch biometrics data of tagged individuals, use the following commands in R:

```r
# detections
detections <- get_detections(
  common_names = "all", # all common names
  #common_names = c("Cownose',"Gulf Sturgeon), # specify common name
  transmitters = c("A69-1604-60495","A69-1303-46570","A69-9001-16605"), # "A69-1303-46570" (V13) and "A69-9001-16605" (V16) should be 60,326 and "A69-1604-60495" (V13) a paddle should be 1,185
  transmitterTypes = c("V13","V16"),  # only V13 and V16 transmitter types
  #transmitterTypes = "all",  # for all transmitter types
  start_date = "all", # use "all" or leave unspecified for all dates
  end_date = "all", # use "all" or leave unspecified for all dates
  token = auth$token, ws_id = auth$ws_id
)
```
