\title{Get Spatial Metadata for Receivers}
\usage{
get_spatial(
  token = NULL,
  ws_id = NULL,
  StationNames = "all",
  Receivers = "all",
  Area = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{token}{Optional. Fathom API token. If \code{NULL}, \code{authenticate_wrapper()} is called.}

\item{ws_id}{Optional. Workspace ID. If \code{NULL}, \code{authenticate_wrapper()} is called.}

\item{StationNames}{Character vector of station name substrings to filter by (default is "all").}

\item{Receivers}{Character vector of receiver serial number substrings to filter by (default is "all").}

\item{Area}{Optional bounding box filter. A list with two elements: \code{lat = c(minLat, maxLat)} and \code{lon = c(minLon, maxLon)}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with receiver spatial metadata, including:
\describe{
\item{Receiver}{Receiver serial number.}
\item{Station.name}{Name of the deployment station.}
\item{station.id}{Internal station ID.}
\item{Latitude}{Latitude of the receiver position.}
\item{Longitude}{Longitude of the receiver position.}
\item{Depth}{Deployment depth in meters, if available.}
\item{Type}{Receiver type (default is "Hydrophone").}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves spatial metadata for receiver deployments, including latitude, longitude, depth,
and station names. You can filter results by receiver serial numbers, station names, or a bounding box.
